OpenSSH's original README has been moved to README.openssh.  This is a
modified version of the OpenSSH that ships with Ubuntu.

This is NOT upstream.  This is NOT where you should grab your ssh from.
If you're looking for a production ssh that you would want to use in
daily operation, go to:

	http://www.openssh.org/

This is an experimental modification for the author's own interests and
research, and is not intended for a production environment.
